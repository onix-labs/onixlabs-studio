/**
 * Presents the setup wizard: the blocking pass a user walks on a first launch and after every version
 * change, before they reach a tab.
 *
 * The component owns the chrome — the title, the progress rail, and Back/Next/Finish — and switches
 * on the current step's identifier to render its content. It owns none of the sequencing: which steps
 * run, in what order, and what completing means all belong to {@link SetupWizard}, which lives in
 * shared because the welcome screen must consult it too.
 *
 * It lives in the settings feature rather than in a feature of its own because its steps render
 * settings, and the renderers for those (`SettingBindings`, `SettingControl`) belong to this feature.
 * Feature isolation forbids a sibling importing them, and the wizard is the settings feature's
 * onboarding face rather than a thing apart from it.
